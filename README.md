# Smart Irrigation System

I used the Internet of Things to build an affordable smart irrigation system that could easily be scaled to water a garden bed. The hardware prototype consists of a NodeMCU board with an ESP8266 Wi-Fi microchip to which I connected sensors and actuators. I programmed the system to take into account the soil moisture and only water the plants when needed, that is, when the value read from the sensor indicates that the soil is starting to dry. Furthermore, I also set up a web server where I display and plot the real time sensor readings and, although the irrigation is automated, we also want to allow the users to turn the pump on and off by simply pushing a button when they consider necessary. To help with this decision we want to display the current weather as well, so that in event of a rain forecast for example, the pump can easily be turned off by clicking on a button
